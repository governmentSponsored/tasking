# Tasking
Google Apps Script (GAS) based tasking application with a Parse cloud NoSQL database, and jQuery.

#Demo
[Here is the latest stable version of the code](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzyVLq-EpbqWmYDdzUbMNPxMbXNPt3GjEL6WBcol4WAQRChDC8/exec)

[Here is the less stable development version with additional functionality (url parameters, better ui, etc)](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzR8W2kx5v9aj_g2BzTtfePfjehYgNCDyCouDi-odUhxylba6IL/exec)

* Only in Dev: To see the added use of url parameters try any of the following:
 * ?page=myTasks
 * ?page=create
 * ?page=searchTasks
 * ?page=searchTasks&query=finished (this will only work if you have an existing task with the word finish in it somewhere or it's status is finished)

# Overview
Originally this application used google's built-in NoSQL database ScriptDB, but as Google removed that service, this application needed to undergo a massive overhaul.


# Installation
Moving scripts without tons of copy/paste into Google Drive can be relatively tricky. Please follow these instructions:

1. Create an Apps Script Project on your Drive (you may need to connect Apps Script to Drive)
2. Create an account on [Parse](https://www.parse.com/). This will be your NoSQL data store.
3. Create an application, then a class within that application, then be sure to add at least column to it.
4. Copy the following keys under Settings --> Keys
  * Application ID
  * REST API Key
5. Store them as key/value pairs in your script's project properties by opening your project in Google Drive, Selecting File --> Project Properties, and then selecting the Script Properties tab.
  * appId : Application ID
  * restApi : REST API Key
  * class : Class
